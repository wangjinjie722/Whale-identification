-- Download the Data  
We downloaded the data from a kaggle competition, called "Humpback Whale Identification". We used the following kaggle api: `kaggle competitions download -c humpback-whale-identification`. If there is any problem with the api, please check this link for the detailed instructions https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api.  

-- Data Preprocessing  
Since this is a competiton, there is no lablel for the test data on the kaggle. So we splited the train data into two parts: 80% as our train data and 20% as our test data.
